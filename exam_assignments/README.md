# Exam Assignments

1. Every answer for each code assignment is in this directory, written in markdown.
2. Assignments that expect code can be found in one of the folders, which can contain:  
   * `/warmup`, containing the cpp files for the warmup.
   * `/assignment`, containing the cpp files for the actual assignment.
3. In the code subfolders, the source file as well as the compiled files are given. **-WIP-** For more complicated code, the Makefile is also attached.
4. Source files names will be appended by the slide number if they were shown in a slide.
5. If results should have been recorded, they will be in the same folder as the code and called `RESULTS.md`.
