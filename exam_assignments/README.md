# Exam Assignments

1. Every individual exam assignment from each lecture has its own folder.
2. Every folder can contain:  
   * `answers.md`, a markdown file with the written answers for the assignment.
   * `/warmup`, containing the cpp files for the warmup.
   * `/assignment`, containing the cpp files for the actual assignment.
3. In the code subfolders, the source file as well as the compiled files are given. **-WIP-** For more complicated code, the Makefile is also attached.
4. Source files names will be appended by the slide number if they were shown in a slide.
5. If results should have been recorded, they will be in the same folder as the code and called `RESULTS.md`.
